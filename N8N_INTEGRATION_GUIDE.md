# ðŸ”— n8n Integration Guide

## ðŸš¨ Cloud Functions Issue
The Cloud Functions deployment failed due to missing service account permissions. Let me provide you with alternative solutions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution Options

### Option 1: Manual HTTP Function (Recommended for Hackathon)
Since Cloud Functions deployment is having issues, let's create a simple HTTP endpoint that you can call manually.

### Option 2: Direct Frontend Integration
Integrate n8n webhook directly from the frontend.

## ðŸ”§ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your n8n Webhook URL
1. Go to your n8n instance
2. Create a new workflow
3. Add a "Webhook" node
4. Copy the webhook URL (it will look like: `https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/your-webhook-id`)

### Step 2: Configure Frontend Integration
I'll update the frontend to call n8n directly when a CSV is uploaded.

### Step 3: Set Up n8n Workflow
Create a workflow that:
1. Receives CSV data
2. Processes the data
3. Sends results back to Firebase

## ðŸš€ Let's Implement This Now!

I'll create a working solution that bypasses the Cloud Functions issue and integrates directly with n8n.
